### Objective

- Practice using `chown` to change file and directory ownership for a target user (`alice`) and groups.
- Learn and apply common `chown` options (`-v`, `-R`) and user:group notation.
- Verify ownership changes non-interactively with `ls -l` or `stat` for autograder checks.

### Background & Context

The `chown` (change owner) command in Linux is used to change the user and/or group ownership of files and directories. Proper file ownership is essential for enforcing security and access control in multi-user systems. In this lab, you will practice using different `chown` options to modify ownership of individual files and entire directory trees.

**Key `chown` Options to Learn:**

* `-v` or `--verbose`         : Display detailed information about each ownership change as it happens.
* `-R` or `--recursive`       : Apply ownership changes recursively to all files and subdirectories.
* `<user>:<group>`            : Specify both the new owner and group simultaneously.
* `<user>`                    : Change only the file owner, leaving the group unchanged.
* `:<group>`                  : Change only the group ownership, leaving the user unchanged.

This exercise will reinforce your understanding of file permissions, ownership hierarchies, and the impact of recursive operations.

### Tasks

Perform the following three tasks, each using the `chown` command. After executing each command, verify the ownership change with `ls -l`:

1. **Task 1:** Change the owner of `README.md` to `alice`, displaying verbose output.
2. **Task 2:** Change both the owner to `alice` and the group to `projectgroup` for the file `src/module1/file1.txt`, displaying verbose output.
3. **Task 3:** Recursively change ownership of the entire `src` directory (and its contents) so that `alice` is the owner, showing verbose output.

### Submission Template 
* There is **no manual submission file** required for this lab. Instead, an automated grading script will verify the completion of each task by checking the presence and contents of the output files in your working directory.

### Autograding & Evaluation

There is **no manual submission file** for this lab. An automated grading script will verify the completion of each task by inspecting file and directory ownerships:

1. **Task 1 Check:** Confirm that `README.md` is owned by user `alice`.
2. **Task 2 Check:** Confirm that `src/module1/file1.txt` is owned by `alice` and its group is `projectgroup`.
3. **Task 3 Check:** Confirm that all files and subdirectories under `src/` are owned by `alice`.

**Important:**

* The autograder runs `stat` or `ls -l` checks non-interactively; ensure the correct ownership is set.
* Recursive operations must affect all nested files/directories—partial changes will be marked incorrect.
* Exact ownership values are required—mismatched user or group names will cause grading failures.

**Tips for Success:**

* Preview ownership before and after with `ls -l filename` or `ls -lR src/`.
* Use `sudo` to ensure you have permission to change ownership.
* Combine options (e.g., `-Rv`) to see verbose recursive changes in one command.

**Good luck and happy ownership managing!**
