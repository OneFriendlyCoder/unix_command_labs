### Background & Context

In Debian‑based systems, package management is typically handled by two complementary tools:

* **`dpkg`**: The low‑level package manager that installs, queries, and removes individual `.deb` files.

  * Common options:

    * `-i <file.deb>` : Install the specified package.
    * `-r <package>` : Remove a package (keeping its config files).
    * `-P <package>` : Purge a package (removing config files too).
    * `-l`            : List installed packages.
    * `-L <package>` : List files belonging to a package.

* **`apt`**: A higher‑level tool that resolves dependencies, fetches packages from repositories, and manages upgrades.

  * Common options:

    * `install <package>`  : Download and install a package (plus dependencies).
    * `remove <package>`   : Uninstall a package (keeping config files).
    * `purge <package>`    : Uninstall and remove config files.
    * `update`             : Refresh package lists.
    * `upgrade`            : Upgrade all upgradable packages.

This lab will reinforce when to use `dpkg` (local `.deb` files) versus `apt` (online repos) and demonstrate key options for each.

### Tasks

1. **Install `htop`** from the pre‑downloaded `.deb` in `/home/labDirectory/` using `dpkg`, ensuring all dependencies are satisfied.
2. **Install `vim`** using `apt`, refreshing package lists first if necessary.
3. Verify installations by running `htop --version` and `vim --version`, and redirecting their output to `htop.txt` and `vim.txt` respectively in the current directory.

### Submission Template

There is **no manual submission file** required for this lab. Instead, an automated grading script will verify the completion of each task by checking:

* Presence of `htop` and `vim` on the system.
* Existence of `htop.txt` and `vim.txt` containing the correct version strings.

---

**Important:**

* **Dependency errors:** If `dpkg -i` reports missing dependencies, run `sudo apt-get install -f` (or `sudo apt -f install`) to fix them.
* **Non‑interactive mode:** Ensure commands run without prompts (use `-y` with `apt` if needed).
* **Permissions:** Use `sudo` for all installation commands.
* **File paths:** Reference `/home/labDirectory/htop_*.deb` explicitly—do not move the file.

**Good luck and enjoy mastering Debian package tools!**
