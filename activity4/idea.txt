Background & Context : 


In Debian based systems, package management is typically handled by two complementary tools :


`dpkg`: The low level package manager that installs, queries, and removes individual `.deb` files.

  Common options :

      `-i <file.deb>` : Install the specified package.
      `-r <package>` : Remove a package (keeping its config files).
      `-P <package>` : Purge a package (removing config files too).
      `-l`      : List installed packages.
      `-L <package>` : List files belonging to a package.


 `apt`: A higher level tool that resolves dependencies, fetches packages from repositories, and manages upgrades.

  Common options:

       `install <package>` : Download and install a package (plus dependencies).
       `remove <package>`  : Uninstall a package (keeping config files).
       `purge <package>`  : Uninstall and remove config files.
       `update`       : Refresh package lists.
       `upgrade`      : Upgrade all upgradable packages.


This lab will reinforce when to use `dpkg` (local `.deb` files) versus `apt` (online repos) and demonstrate key options for each.


Objective : 

By the end of this lab you will be able to:


    Distinguish between `dpkg` and `apt` and know when to use each tool.
    Install a local `.deb` package with `dpkg -i` and resolve any missing dependencies.
    Use `apt` to refresh package lists and install packages non interactively.
    Verify installed packages by capturing version output to files for automated grading.
    Troubleshoot common dependency errors using `apt -f install` (or `apt-get install -f`).
    Follow lab constraints (non-interactive mode, correct file paths, and avoiding `sudo` for the provided commands).


Tasks : 


    **Install `htop`** from the pre-downloaded `.deb` in `/home/labDirectory/` using `dpkg`, ensuring all dependencies are satisfied.
    **Install `vim`** using `apt`, refreshing package lists first if necessary.
    Verify installations by running `htop --version` and `vim --version`, and redirecting their output to `htop.txt` and `vim.txt` respectively in the current directory.


Submission Template : 


    There is **no manual submission file** required for this lab. Instead, an automated grading script will verify the completion of each task by checking:
    Presence of `htop` and `vim` on the system.
    Existence of `htop.txt` and `vim.txt` containing the correct version strings.



**Important:**

    Dependency errors: If `dpkg -i` reports missing dependencies, run `apt-get install -f` (or `apt -f install`) to fix them.
    Non interactive mode: Ensure commands run without prompts (use `-y` with `apt` if needed).
    Permissions: Do not use `sudo` for installation commands.
    File paths: Reference `/home/labDirectory/htop_*.deb` explicitly do not move the file.


**Good luck and enjoy mastering Debian package tools!**
