Background & Context : 

Linux provides the `ss` (socket statistics) utility to investigate socket usage on the system. Unlike its predecessor `netstat`, `ss` is faster and offers more filtering capabilities. In this lab, you will explore how to list various categories of TCP and UDP sockets, including established connections, numeric address displays, and listening sockets.

Objectives : 

By completing this assignment, you will :

1. Gain hands-on experience with the `ss` command and its options.

2. Learn to filter socket listings by protocol, state, and numeric output.

3. Interpret command output to understand active network connections and services.
Tasks & Learning the `ss` Options : 

In this section, you will explore the various options supported by the `ss` utility.

Protocol Selection : 

     `-t` : Display **TCP** sockets.
     `-u` : Display **UDP** sockets.
     `-w` : Display **RAW** sockets.
     `-x` : Display **UNIX** domain sockets.

State Filtering : 

    `state ESTABLISHED` : Show only sockets in the established connection state.
    `state LISTEN` : Show only sockets in listening mode.
    (Hint) Use `ss --help` or `man ss` to discover other states (e.g., `TIME-WAIT`, `CLOSE-WAIT`).

Numeric vs. Resolved Addresses : 

    `-n` : Show IP addresses and port numbers in numeric form (do not resolve hostnames or service names).
    Without `-n` : `ss` will perform DNS lookups or service name resolutions, showing human-readable names.

Additional Useful Options : 

    `-a` or `--all` : Show **all** sockets, regardless of state.
    `-p` : Display **process** details (PID and program name) using sockets.
    `-4` / `-6` : Restrict output to **IPv4** or **IPv6** sockets, respectively.
    `-o` : Show timer information (e.g., retransmission timers) for each socket.
    `-e` : Provide extended socket information (e.g., congestion control, queue limits).

Tasks :

    For each of the six objectives below, construct an `ss` command by selecting and combining the appropriate options listed above.
    Test your command in the terminal and verify its output matches the intended objective.

TASK 1 : List all TCP sockets in the ESTABLISHED state

TASK 2 : Show TCP sockets with IP addresses and ports numeric

TASK 3 : Display all active UDP sockets

TASK 4 : List UDP sockets with numeric addresses and ports

TASK 5 : List all TCP sockets in LISTEN state

TASK 6 : List all UDP sockets in LISTEN state
Submission Template :

    Open /home/labDirectory/submissions.txt in the clabs text editor.
    For each of the six lines, remove the angle-bracketed placeholder entirely and replace it with the exact ss command that fulfills the described objective.
    Do not add, remove, or modify any other lines or formatting within the file.
    Save the changes to the file.
