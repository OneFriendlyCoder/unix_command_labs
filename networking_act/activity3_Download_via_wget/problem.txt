Problem Statement : 

You are a seasoned network administrator at a mid-sized corporation. One crisp Monday morning, you received an urgent email from the software deployment team: a critical update file needed to be downloaded from an external server for the upcoming system patch rollout. The file, "system_update", was hosted on localhost:30001/system_update, and the team required it to be stored in a specific directory on the local network storage for further testing and deployment.


Part 1:

* Run the bash command to download the file named system_update

* Save the file in the directory named "downloads" in the current working directory

* Answer the questions present in the solutions.txt file.

  -> Which flag allows to specify the directory where the downloaded file will be saved?

  -> Which flag can be used to limit the download speed?


Note : In the solutions.txt file, replace the <command> to input the actual command and replace the <Answer> to write the actual answers.
