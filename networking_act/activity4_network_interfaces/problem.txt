Background Details : 

You are a network administrator at Wizard-Network Solutions, a company that maintains a large data center with hundreds of Linux based servers. Recently, intermittent connectivity issues have been reported from a subset of servers. Preliminary investigations suggest that misconfigured network interfaces might be the culprit some servers may be missing a required management IPv4 address or have an unintended extra IPv4 address due to legacy configuration.

To triage this quickly, the team needs an automated way to list each servers configured IPv4 addresses (including the CIDR suffix) so they can be compared against the expected inventory.
Objective : 

     Use the `ip` command to list all network interfaces and their configured IP addresses.
     Filter the output so only IPv4 addresses including the CIDR suffix are captured.
     Store the resulting IPv4 list in a file named `ipv4_addresses.txt` in the working directory.
     Record the exact command you used in `/home/labDirectory/solutions.txt` by replacing the `<command>` placeholder.

Task : 

1. Run a command on the system that produces a list of IPv4 addresses (with CIDR suffixes) for the local host.  

2. Redirect or write that filtered output to `ipv4_addresses.txt` in the current working directory.  

3. In `/home/labDirectory/solutions.txt`, replace the `<command>` placeholder with the exact command you executed to generate `ipv4_addresses.txt`.  

4. Do not change any other text or formatting in `solutions.txt`.
Submission : 

     Edit `/home/labDirectory/solutions.txt`: replace `<command>` with the exact command you ran to produce `ipv4_addresses.txt`.  
     Ensure a file named `ipv4_addresses.txt` exists in your working directory and contains only IPv4 addresses (each including the CIDR suffix) this file will be validated.  
     Do not modify any other lines or formatting in `solutions.txt`.

Important Info : 

    Recommended base tool: the `ip` command (part of `iproute2`). Avoid using deprecated tools like `ifconfig`.  
    The grader expects only IPv4 addresses with CIDR in `ipv4_addresses.txt` (examples: `192.168.1.10/24`, `10.0.0.5/8`), one per line.  
    Ensure the command you put into `/home/labDirectory/solutions.txt` is exactly the command you ran (the grader matches exact text).  
    Run your command and inspect `ipv4_addresses.txt` (e.g., `cat ipv4_addresses.txt`) to confirm output contains only IPv4/CIDR entries before submitting.  
    If you run the command on a multi interface host, expect multiple lines (one per configured IPv4 address). If a host has no IPv4 address, `ipv4_addresses.txt` should be empty (the grader will handle that case).
